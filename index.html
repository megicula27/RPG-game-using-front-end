                <h3>Urza</h3>
                <p>Urza is a cunning, scheming, but just jerk who might very well be a villain with good intentions.
                    However, he did destroy Phyrexia and Yawgmoth, which solidifies his anti-hero status</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Tefari</h3>
                <p>Teferi is one of the few characters from the earlier years of Magic to still be relevant within the
                    game's lore. As a time mage, Teferi is a notable and powerful theme that can cohesively tie a series
                    of spells together.</p>
            </div>

        <a href="#" onclick="GameManager.SetGameStart('Karn')">
            <img src="/heroes/karn.jpg" alt="Karn">
            <div>
                <h3>Karn</h3>
                <p>While many players primarily associated Karn with the strength of the card, Karn Liberated, he is one
                    of the few characters that bridge the earlier years of Magic lore with the current era. First
                    appearing all the way back in Urza's Saga in 1998 as Karn, Silver Golem, Karn has served prominent
                    positions in both the Scars of Mirrodin Block as well as Dominaria.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Sorin Markov</h3>
                <p>Few Planeswalkers are as closely tied to their home plane as the vampiric Sorin Markov is to the
                    plane of Innistrad. As the immortal creator of the iconic Avacyn, Sorin is both inegrally connected
                    to Innistrad's history as well as the history of the Eldrazi.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Nissa Revane</h3>
                <p>Perhaps one of the safest guesses of a character to receive a Signature Spellbook, Nissa Revane is a
                    prominent core figure in Magic's lore and is one of the characters most closesly affiliated with
                    green mana.</p>
